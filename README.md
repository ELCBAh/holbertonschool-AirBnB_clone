# AirBnB clone - The console

fotito facherita de HBNB THE CONSOLE

## Description of the project:
Welcome to the Airbnb Clone Command Interpreter project! This is the first step in building a cool web application that works just like Airbnb. In this project we've created a command-line interface (CLI) that lets you manage different things in our Airbnb clone, like users, places, states, cities, amenities and reviews.

## Description of the command iterpreter:

### Execution
The shell for the Airbnb Clone Command Interpreter can be used in both interactive and non-interactive modes.


### Interactive Mode
In interactive mode, you can run the command interpreter by executing the console.py script. Once started, the shell prompt (hbnb) will appear, indicating that you can enter commands. 
You can then type commands, press Enter to execute them, and receive the corresponding output. Here's an example:
